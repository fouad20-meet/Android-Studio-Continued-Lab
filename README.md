# Android Studio Continued Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn to implement the essentials of Android Studio and working with Java & XML!  

By the end of this lab, you will have a template of a signin page.  

## Instructions:

In this lab, we'll be creating a sign in page using TextView, EditText & Button!  

1. Designing the views of the MainActivity:
    - Give the `EditText` a **rounded border** around the input. (Google how!)
    - Give the `Buttons` **rounded corners** and **change their color**.

2. SignUpActivity:
    - Create a new Activity called SignUpActivity (Empty Activity), the Activity should contain:
          1. A TextView that says: Sign Up.
          2. 3 EditTexts: Name, Email & Password.
          3. A submit Button.
    - When the submit button in the MainActivity is clicked:
        - Go to the SignUpActivity.

3. HomeActivity & Menu:
      1. Create a new Activity called HomeActivity (Empty Activity), the Activity should contain:
        - A TextView that says: Welcome to our App.
      2. Create a menu directory, then a menu file:
        - Add an Item with the text "Sign Out".
      3. Inflate the menu to HomeActivity.
      4. Implement onOptionItemSelected function:
        - When signout is pressed, return to the MainActivity.

### Bonus:

1. When you go to HomeActivity, send the email of the user as a variable and display it in HomeActivity.
